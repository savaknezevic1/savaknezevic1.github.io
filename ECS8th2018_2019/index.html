   In this class, I learned so much about hings that I didn't even know existed such as HTML and CSS code and I feel like I can code anything that I think of.<br>
   <p>!!!FUTURE ECS STUDENTS!!!:DO NOT WAIT UNTIL THE LAST SECOND TO DO YOUR CODING AND HOMEWORK BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT OF IT! At first, the assignments and coding might seem really boring like they did to me in the beginning but in the end when you push through and learn how to code, you will feel so amazing and knowledgable!<br>
